   1.The Grid should present critical data points for an intuitive and structured view.
   
3. Drill Through Functionality:
   
   1.Users should be able to drill through from the main reports to explore underlying data for detailed insights.

   2.The drilled-through data should be exportable to a CSV file based on user requirements.
   
5. Drill Down, Drill Up, and Hierarchy:
   
   1.The Grid should support hierarchical navigation, allowing users to drill down and up for in-depth data exploration.
